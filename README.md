# Road-Accident-Data-Analysis(My-Excel-Projects)
## Project Objective
Client wants to create a road accident dashboard for a year 2021 and 2022 so that they can have an Insight on this particular below requirements

## Questions (KPIs)
### Primary KPI's:
- Total Casualties taken place after the accident
- Total Casualties & percentage of total with respect to accident
- maximum casualties by type of vehicle 
### Secondary KPI's:
- Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type
- Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for Current Year and Previous 
- Maximum casualties by Road Type Distribution of total casualties by Road Surface 
- Relation between Casualties by Area/ Location & by Day/ Night

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R_uaoZL18nRbqC_MULVne90h3SdRbAyn/edit?gid=1319047066#gid=1319047066">Dataset</a>


## Process
- Requirement gathering from client
- Identify the Stakeholders of the Project
- Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.
- Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
- Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.
- Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic.

## Dashboard

## Project Insight:
The dashboard analyzes road accident data for the years 2021 and 2022, covering nearly 3 million records. 
It focuses on identifying patterns, trends, and key factors contributing to casualties. Key observations include:

Primary KPI: Total casualties and their percentage relative to accidents, with breakdowns by vehicle type.

Trends: Monthly comparison between 2021 and 2022 shows clear seasonal variations, with notable spikes during specific months.

Vehicle Impact: Certain vehicle types contribute disproportionately to maximum casualties.

Location Factors: Road type and surface conditions show a direct correlation with casualty numbers.

Time Factors: Higher casualties occur in specific time frames (day/night) depending on area type.

## Final Conclusion:
The analysis reveals that improving road safety requires targeted interventions on high-risk vehicle types, specific road surfaces, and dangerous road types. Seasonal spikes suggest the need for temporary preventive measures during peak months. Insights from the dashboard can guide policymakers and transport authorities to design data-driven safety strategies, allocate resources efficiently, and reduce future casualties.
